### Hi, I'm Marcelo! 👋

In a Hurry to Learn  
In a hurry to learn, eager to ship,  
Carrying ideas that constantly slip.  
More than I code, they swirl in my mind,  
Fueling my journey, leaving none behind.  

In every free moment, I study, I grow,  
Finding joy in the depths of what I know.  
The path ahead may twist and turn,  
But it’s the drive that makes me burn.  

Feel free to reach on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mararraes/),  
let's talk, let's build,  
For in every line, a vision is fulfilled.
